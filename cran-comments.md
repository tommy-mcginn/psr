## Resubmission

This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Used the Authors@R field in the DESCRIPTION to declare Maintainer, Authors, and Contributors with their appropriate roles with person() calls.
* Eliminated messages to the console that cannot be easily suppressed, instead printing objects that I generated to extract the information a user is interested in (or so I think; if there are places where this is still an issue, please let me know where those places are, so that I can make the necessary changes).

## Test environments
* local R installation, R 4.0.4
* ubuntu 16.04 (on travis-ci), R 4.0.4
* win-builder (devel)

## R CMD check results

There were no ERRORs, WARNINGs, or NOTEs.

## Downstream dependencies

There are currently no downstream dependencies for this package.

* This is a new release.
