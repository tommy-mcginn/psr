Description: Contains functions to compute statistics relevant to performance scientists, coaches, and athletes. The functions within the package that report group-wide statistics have to do with measurement instrument reliability and individual change of athletes. Many of them come from the work of Hopkins (2000) <doi:10.2165/00007256-200030010-00001>. There are also functions that apply a particular statistical concept to each measurement in the data.
